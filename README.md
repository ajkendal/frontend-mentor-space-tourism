## Overview

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Design & prototyping tool
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - Platform for frontend deployment & hosting

### What I learned

While working with `display: grid` on the `<body>` element, I ran into an issue where the grid would not expand to cover the full viewport. To resolve this, I created a `.page` class and applied it to the outer `<div>` of each page. Although it felt redundant to duplicate styles between the `body` and `.page`, this approach was the only reliable way I found to achieve full-page grid layouts in a Next.js/React environment.

```css
body,
.page {
  font-family: var(--ff-sans-normal);
  font-size: var(--fs-400);
  color: hsl(var(--clr-white));
  background-color: hsl(var(--clr-dark));
  line-height: 1.5;
  min-height: 100vh;

  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: min-content 1fr;
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: bottom center;
}
```
